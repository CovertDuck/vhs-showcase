# VHS Showcase

`vhs` is a neat tool allowing you to generate clean and polished terminal operations videos. This repository is meant to host and showcase demonstrations of my work.

This wouldn't be possible if not for the terrific work of the [Charm](https://github.com/charmbracelet/charm) team! Please, do give them a look: <https://charm.sh>
